Ezra 1"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by he mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up
the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia, so that he mad a proclamation throughtout all his kingdom, and also put it in riting, saying,
2 "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth the LORD GOD of heaven has given me. And He has commanded me to 
build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD GOD of Israel ( HE is God), which is in Jerusalem.
4 And whoever is left in any place where he dwells, let the men of his place help him with silver and gold, with goods and 
livestock, besides the freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
