NKJV
1 Corinthians 4:12 "And we labor, working with our own hands.
Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; 
13 being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world,
the offscouring of all things until now."

2 Corinthians 7:9 "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye 
sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner,
that ye might receive damage by us in nothing."

1 Corinthians 13:1->13 " If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, 
I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all
mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, 
it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled;
where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when perfection comes,
the imperfect disappears."

Ezekiel 36:25 ...God will cleanse with pure water!
