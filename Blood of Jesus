Matthew 23:23 and Luke 11:42 as keys to unlock the composition of Jesus' blood. 

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, 
and have omitted the weightier matters 
of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

Luke 11:42
But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue
and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

An infinite balancing rod where the lightest pieces of information lift the heaviest most desirable actions, judgement, mercy, faith and the love of God.
Using small sacrifices in lossless compression system.
