Psalm 119 midpoint of the word



Reconciled in Christ
Colossians 1:19
"For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself,
by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of his cross.
And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled 22 in the body of
His flesh through death, to present you blameless, and above reproach in His sight---23 if indeed you continue in the
faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached
to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.
